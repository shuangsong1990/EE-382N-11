\section{Recap}
Happened-before relation ($\rightarrow$) is the smallest relation such that
\newline
1. if ($e \prec f$) in the same process, then (e$\rightarrow$f) where $\prec$ is locally precedes.
\newline
2. if ($e \rightsquigarrow f$), then (e$\rightarrow$f) where $\rightsquigarrow$ is remotely precedes.
\newline
3. if ($\exists g: $($e \rightarrow g$) $\land$ ($g \rightarrow f$)), then (e$\rightarrow$f).

Thus, 
$\rightarrow$ : $(\prec \cup \rightsquigarrow)^+$ where + is transitive closure.

\section{Logical Clock}
\subsection{Definition}
A map C:E $\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ is a logical clock if 
$\forall$ e,f $\in$ E: ($e \rightarrow f$) $\Rightarrow$ C(e) $<$ C(f).
In short, C is the function that preserves the structure.
\subsection{Logical Clock Algorithm}
The variable c (integer) is initialized to 0.
\newline
1. For internal events, c++ (increment c by 1).
\newline
2. For send event, c++ and piggyback c with message.
\newline
3. For receive event of message having logical value d, c := max(c,d) + 1.
\newline
{\tt Note:C(e)$<$C(f) does not imply that e$\rightarrow$f}
\newline
Consider, C(e) = 5 and C(f) = 7, we can only conclude that f did not happen before e. Two possibilities exist : e happened before or concurrent with f.

Sometimes, events need to have unique timestamps.In this case, (logical clock value, Process ID) becomes the timestamp. In case of a tie, event with smallest process id wins.

\section{Physical Clock}
\subsection{Terminology}
Let G = (V,E) be undirected graph representing topology.
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
\begin{axis}[
    axis lines = left,
    xlabel = $t$,
    ylabel = {$C(t)$},
]
%Below the red line is defined
\addplot [
    domain=0:10, 
    samples=50, 
    color=blue,
]
{x};
\addlegendentry{ideal}
%Here the blue line is defined
\addplot [
    domain=0:10, 
    samples=50, 
    color=red,
    ]
    {2*x};
\addlegendentry{running fast}
\addplot [
    domain=0:10, 
    samples=50, 
    color=black,
    ]
    {0.5*x};
\addlegendentry{running slow}
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Drift rate = $| 1 - \frac{dc}{dt}| < \kappa$
\newline
\newline
$\tau$ = Synchronization Period (Every $\tau$ units of time, send your clock value to all your neighboring nodes)
\subsection{Lamport's Physical Clock Algorithm}
1. Assume, every sent message takes time in [$\mu, \mu+\xi$] to reach destination.
\newline
2. On receiving a message timestamped with D, C:= max$(C, D+\mu)^+$ where + indicates that it is fractionally bigger (smallest level of granularity).
Still, there exists uncertainty in synchronization($\epsilon$)
\newline
$|C_{i}(t) - C_{j}(t)| < \epsilon$  
\newline
Diameter of the graph(d) = $max_{i,j}$ (length of the shortest path from i to j)
\newline

$\boxed{\epsilon \approx d(2\kappa\tau + \xi)}$
\newline

Advantage of physical clock is that is satisfies logic clock property. 

\section{Down Sets}
\subsection{Terminology}
Let (X,$\leqslant$) be any poset. We call a subset Y $\subseteq$ X a down-set if:\\

\centerline{(z $\in$ Y) $\land$ (y $\leqslant$ z)$\Rightarrow$ (y $\in$ Y).}

Example 1\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.0 in]{Downset}\\
\end{center}
Y = \{ D \} is not a downset.\\
Y = \{ C, A \} is a downset.\\
Example 2\\
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3.0 in]{Downset2}\\
\end{center}
D[\, E ]\, = \{ A, D, E \}

\section{Principal Ideals}
It refers to an ideal in a poset P generated by a single element x of P, which is to say the set of all elements less than or equal to x in P.

\section{Vector clocks}
When using vector clocks, the time domain is represented by a set of n-dimensional non-negative integer vector. A process Pi maintains a vector $VT_{i}$[\,1...n]\, where $VT_{i}$[\,i]\, is the local logical clock of Pi and describes the logical time progress at the process Pi.\\

Process Pi uses the following two rules R1 and R2 to update its clock:


\begin{itemize}
\item R1: Before executing an event, process Pi, updates its local logical time:\\
\centerline{$VT_{i}$[\,i]\, = $VT_{i}$[\,i ]\, + d where d  $>$ 0}\\
\item R2: Each message m is piggybacked with the vector VT of the sender process at sending time. On the receipt of such a message (m,vt), process Pi executes the following actions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Update its global logical time as follows:\\
\centerline{1 $\leq$ K $\leq$ n : $VT_{i}$[\,i]\, := max($VT_{i}$[\,k]\,, VT[\,k]\,) }
\item Execute R1
\item Deliver the message m

\end{enumerate}




\end{itemize}

\section{Dilworth's Theorem(1950's)}
\subsection{Theorem}
Any poset can be decomposed into w chains where w is the width of the poset. This is necessary and sufficient condition.
\subsection{Proof}
The basic idea is that when new element x comes up, we have to show that we can add it to one of the existing w chains.
